<p>I continued my theme on Zombies mainly because its easier for me to continue the ideas for this then try to make a whole new story in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>I had some issues with the project getting the returns to work correctly with each type of function wasn't working to well for me and I know I didn't do everything correctly which is my fault for putting the majority of this project off until the last minute but life doesn't always give you the time you need.</p>
